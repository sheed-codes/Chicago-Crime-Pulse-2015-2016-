Overview

This project analyzes Chicago crime data using:

API data ingestion (Socrata Open Data API)

SQL querying inside Python

Time-series analysis

Anomaly detection (crime spike identification)

Forecast baseline modeling

The dataset contains reported incidents filtered between approximately 2015–2016 due to API safety limits applied during data collection.

📊 Key Observations
1️⃣ Crime Volume Patterns

Monthly citywide incidents show clear seasonality:

Crime counts increase during late spring and summer months.

Peak activity occurs mid-year.

Incident counts decline toward winter months.

This seasonal behavior suggests environmental or social drivers such as:

Increased outdoor activity

Weather patterns

Population mobility changes.

2️⃣ Arrest Rate Variation by Crime Type

The arrest-rate heatmap reveals strong differences between offense categories:

Some crime types show consistently high arrest rates (e.g., narcotics-related or enforcement-driven categories).

Others show significantly lower arrest success relative to incident volume.

Possible interpretations:

Certain offenses are proactive enforcement-driven rather than reactive investigations.

High-volume property crimes may have lower clearance probability.

3️⃣ Crime Spikes (Anomaly Detection)

Rolling z-score anomaly detection highlights unusual increases relative to historical patterns.

Instead of relying on absolute incident counts, spikes were identified using statistical deviation from recent trends.

Insights:

Not all high-count months are anomalies.

Spikes represent deviations from expected seasonal behavior.

This approach avoids false alarms caused by predictable seasonal peaks.

4️⃣ Incident Volume vs Arrest Rate

Scatter analysis suggests:

High incident volume does not necessarily correlate with higher arrest rates.

Some lower-volume categories achieve higher arrest efficiency.

This reinforces the need to evaluate both metrics simultaneously rather than independently.

5️⃣ Forecast Baseline

A seasonal naive baseline model was implemented:

Future values predicted using previous seasonal periods (12-month lag).

Serves as a benchmark for future predictive models.

Purpose:

Establish baseline expectations.

Measure future model improvement against simple assumptions.

🧠 Analytical Approach

The project intentionally combines:

SQL for aggregation and grouping.

Python for transformation, modeling, and visualization.

API-based data ingestion rather than static CSV files.

This workflow mirrors real-world analytics pipelines used in:

Public safety analytics

Intelligence analysis

Operations research.

⚠️ Limitations

API pagination safety limits restrict dataset size.

Time range reflects available fetched data rather than full historical archive.

Forecast model is baseline only, not optimized predictive modeling.

🚀 Future Improvements

Pull full multi-year dataset via automated batching.

Add geospatial hotspot analysis (GIS clustering).

Implement advanced forecasting (SARIMA / Prophet / ML regression).

Build dashboard visualization.
